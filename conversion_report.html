Neben dem Nachweis entsprechender Zertifikate als Diversifikationsmerkmal gegen\"{u}ber Mitbewerbern k\"{o}nnen Zertifikate \"{u}ber die Einhaltung von Standards auch durch den Gesetzgeber vorgeschrieben werden. Ein Beispiel hierf\"{u}r sind Zertifikate aus Hochsicherheitsbereichen wie Atomkraftwerken. Das Seminar wurde wie eine wissenschaftliche Konferenz organisiert: Die Einreichungen wurden in einem zweistufigen Peer-Review-Verfahren begutachtet. In der ersten Stufe wurde eine Begutachtung der studentischen Arbeiten durch Kommilitonen durchgef\"{u}hrt, in der zweiten Stufe eine Begutachtung durch die Betreuer. In verschiedenen Sessions wurden die Artikel an zwei Konferenztagen pr\"{a}sentiert. Die besten Beitr\"{a}ge wurden durch best paper awards ausgezeichnet. Diese gingen an Fabian Brosig f\"{u}r seine Arbeit Cost Benefit Analysis Method (CBAM), an Jakob Blomer f\"{u}r die Arbeit Zertifizierung von Softwarebenchmarks und an Grischa Liebel f\"{u}r die Arbeit SWT - Das Standard Widget Toolkit, denen hiermit noch einmal herzlich zu dieser herausragenden Leistung gratuliert wird. Erg\"{a}nzend zu den Vortr\"{a}gen der Seminarteilnehmer wurde ein eingeladener Vortrag gehalten. Herr Dr. Dirk Feuerhelm von der 1&1 Internet AG gab dabei dankenswerterweise in seinem Vortrag mit dem Thema Softskills -- Ist das objektorientiert oder modellgetrieben? einen Einblick in die Aufgaben als Leiter der Software-Entwicklung</blockquote></div>

The models will be automatically maintained during operation. To derive performance predictions, we propose a tailorable model solving approach to provide flexibility in view of prediction accuracy and analysis overhead.}</blockquote></div>

Nowadays, software systems have to fulfill increasingly stringent requirements for performance and scalability. To ensure that a system meets its performance requirements during operation, the ability to predict its performance under different configurations and workloads is essential. Most performance analysis tools currently used in industry focus on monitoring the current system state. They provide low-level monitoring data without any performance prediction capabilities. For performance prediction, performance models are normally required. However, building predictive performance models manually requires a lot of time and effort. In this paper, we present a method for automated extraction of performance models of Java EE applications, based on monitoring data collected during operation. We extract instances of the Palladio Component Model (PCM) - a performance meta-model targeted at component-based systems. We evaluate the model extraction method in the context of a case study with a real-world enterprise application. Even though the extraction requires some manual intervention, the case study demonstrates that the existing gap between low-level monitoring data and high-level performance models can be closed.

During the design phase, performance prediction helps to evaluate different design alternatives. At deployment time, it facilitates system sizing and capacity planning. During operation, predicting the effect of changes in the workload or in the system configuration is beneficial for run-time performance management. The alternative to performance prediction is to deploy the system in an environment reflecting the configuration of interest and conduct experiments measuring the system performance under the respective workloads. Such experiments, however, are normally very expensive and time-consuming and therefore often considered not to be economically viable. To enable performance prediction we need an abstraction of the real system that incorporates performance-relevant data, i.e., a performance model. Based on such a model, performance analysis can be carried out. Unfortunately, building predictive performance models manually requires a lot of time and effort. The model must be designed to reflect the abstract system structure and capture its performance-relevant aspects. In addition, model parameters like resource demands or system configuration parameters have to be determined. Given the costs of building performance models, techniques for automatic extraction of models based on observation of the system at run-time are highly desirable. During system development, such models can be exploited to evaluate the performance of system prototypes. During operation, an automatically extracted performance model can be applied for efficient and performance-aware resource management. For example, if one observes an increased user workload and assumes a steady workload growth rate, performance predictions help to determine when the system would reach its saturation point. This way, system operators can react to the changing workload before the system has failed to meet its performance objectives thus avoiding a violation of service level agreements (SLAs). Current performance analysis tools used in industry mostly focus on profiling and monitoring transaction response times and resource consumption. The tools often provide large amounts of low level data while important information needed for building performance models is missing, e.g., the resource demands of individual components. In this article, we present a method for automated extraction of performance models for Java EE applications during operation.

In contrast to low level mathematical models like, e.g., queueing networks, PCM is a high-level UML-like design-oriented model that captures the performance-relevant aspects of the system architecture.

  abstract = {Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) represent an architectural shift for building business applications based on loosely-coupled services. In a multi-layered SOA environment the exact conditions under which services are to be delivered can be formally specified by Service Level Agreements (SLAs). However, typical SLAs are just specified at the customer-level and do not allow service providers to manage their IT stack accordingly as they have no insight on how customer-level SLAs translate to metrics or parameters at the various layers of the IT stack. In this paper we present a technical architecture for a multi-level SLA management framework. We discuss the fundamental components and in- terfaces in this architecture and explain the developed integrated framework. Furthermore, we show results from a qualitative evaluation of the framework in the context of an open reference case.},

In such early stages of the software life-cycle, only a little information is available about the system?s implementation and execution environment.

Parametric performance completions are independent of a specific platform, reflect performance-relevant software configurations, and capture the influence of different usage scenarios. To evaluate the prediction accuracy of the completion for Message-oriented Middleware, we conducted a real-world case study with the SPECjms2007 Benchmark [http://www.spec.org/jms2007/].

<div id="abstract-of-happe2009a" class="inline-bib" style="display:none;"><blockquote>Performance prediction methods can help software architects to identify potential performance problems, such as bottlenecks, in their software systems during the design phase. In such early stages of the software life-cycle, only a little information is available about the system?s implementation and execution environment. However, these details are crucial for accurate performance predictions. Performance completions close the gap between available high-level models and required low-level details. Using model-driven technologies, transformations can include details of the implementation and execution environment into abstract performance models. However, existing approaches do not consider the relation of actual implementations and performance models used for prediction. Furthermore, they neglect the broad variety of possible implementations and middleware platforms, possible configurations, and possible usage scenarios. In this paper, we (i) establish a formal relation between generated performance models and generated code, (ii) introduce a design and application process for parametric performance completions, and (iii) develop a parametric performance completion for Message-oriented Middleware according to our method. Parametric performance completions are independent of a specific platform, reflect performance-relevant software configurations, and capture the influence of different usage scenarios.

  abstract = {{As modern enterprise software systems become increasingly dynamic, workload forecasting techniques are gaining in importance as a foundation for online capacity planning and resource management. Time series analysis covers a broad spectrum of methods to calculate workload forecasts based on history monitoring data. Related work in the field of workload forecasting mostly concentrates on evaluating specific methods and their individual optimisation potential or on predicting Quality-of-Service (QoS) metrics directly. As a basis, we present a survey on established forecasting methods of the time series analysis concerning their benefits and drawbacks and group them according to their computational overheads. In this paper, we propose a novel self-adaptive approach that selects suitable forecasting methods for a given context based on a decision tree and direct feedback cycles together with a corresponding implementation. The user needs to provide only his general forecasting objectives. In several experiments and case studies based on real world workload traces, we show that our implementation of the approach provides continuous and reliable forecast results at run-time. The results of this extensive evaluation show that the relative error of the individual forecast points is significantly reduced compared to statically applied forecasting methods, e.g. in an exemplary scenario on average by 37%. In a case study, between 55% and 75% of the violations of a given service level agreement can be prevented by applying proactive resource provisioning based on the forecast results of our implementation.}},

Originating from the field of physics and economics, the term elasticity is nowadays heavily used in the context of cloud computing. In this context, elasticity is commonly understood as the ability of a system to automatically provision and de-provision computing resources on demand as workloads change. However, elasticity still lacks a precise definition as well as representative metrics coupled with a benchmarking methodology to enable comparability of systems. Existing definitions of elasticity are largely inconsistent and unspecific leading to confusion in the use of the term and its differentiation from related terms such as scalability and efficiency; the proposed measurement methodologies do not provide means to quantify elasticity without mixing it with efficiency or scalability aspects. In this short paper, we propose a precise definition of elasticity and analyze its core properties and requirements explicitly distinguishing from related terms such as scalability, efficiency, and agility. Furthermore, we present a set of appropriate elasticity metrics and sketch a new elasticity tailored benchmarking methodology addressing the special requirements on workload design and calibration.

<div id="abstract-of-KiHeKo2014-ICPEDemo-LIMBO" class="inline-bib" style="display:none;"><blockquote>{Modern software systems are expected to deliver reliable performance under highly variable load 	intensities while at the same time making efficient use of dynamically allocated resources. Conventional benchmarking frameworks provide limited support for emulating such highly variable and dynamic load profiles and workload scenarios. Industrial benchmarks typically use workloads with constant or stepwise increasing load intensity, or they simply replay recorded workload traces. In this paper, we present LIMBO - an Eclipse-based tool for modeling variable load intensity profiles based on the Descartes Load Intensity Model as an underlying modeling formalism.}</blockquote></div>

The model calibration, validation and evaluation is based on data measured on a System z9 (Trademark of IBM in USA and/or other countries) as a proof of concept. The results show that performance predictions can identify performance bottlenecks and evaluate design alternatives in early stages of system development. The experiences gained were that performance modeling helps to understand and analyze a system. Hence, this case study substantiates that performance modeling is applicable in industry and a valuable method for evaluating design decisions.},

<div id="abstract-of-HuBeRaScRe2010-ICSE-PerfMod" class="inline-bib" style="display:none;"><blockquote>In software engineering, performance and the integration of performance analysis methodologies gain increasing importance, especially for complex systems. Well-developed methods and tools can predict non-functional performance properties like response time or resource utilization in early design stages, thus promising time and cost savings. However, as performance modeling and performance prediction is still a young research area, the methods are not yet well-established and in wide-spread industrial use. This work is a case study of the applicability of the Palladio Component Model as a performance prediction method in an industrial environment. We model and analyze different design alternatives for storage virtualization on an IBM (Trademark of IBM in USA and/or other countries) system. The model calibration, validation and evaluation is based on data measured on a System z9 (Trademark of IBM in USA and/or other countries) as a proof of concept. The results show that performance predictions can identify performance bottlenecks and evaluate design alternatives in early stages of system development. The experiences gained were that performance modeling helps to understand and analyze a system. Hence, this case study substantiates that performance modeling is applicable in industry and a valuable method for evaluating design decisions.</blockquote></div>

Nowadays, virtualization solutions are gaining increasing importance. By enabling the sharing of physical resources, thus making resource usage more efficient, they promise energy and cost savings. Additionally, virtualization is the key enabling technology for Cloud Computing and server consolidation. However, the effects of sharing resources on system performance are not yet well-understood. This makes performance prediction and performance management of services deployed in such dynamic systems very challenging. Because of the large variety of virtualization solutions, a generic approach to predict the performance influences of virtualization platforms is highly desirable. In this paper, we present a hierarchical model capturing the major performance-relevant factors of virtualization platforms. We then propose a general methodology to quantify the influence of the identified factors based on an empirical approach using benchmarks. Finally, we present a case study of Citrix XenServer 5.5, a state-of-the-art virtualization platform.

Modern architectures often utilize event-based communication which enables loosely-coupled interactions between components and leads to improved system scalability.

In this paper, we present an extension of the Palladio Component Model (PCM) and the Palladio software quality prediction framework, enabling the modeling of event-based communication in component-based architectures. The contributions include: i) a meta-model extension supporting events as first class entities, ii) a model-to-model transformation from the extended to the original PCM, iii) an integration of the transformation into the Palladio tool chain allowing to use existing model solution techniques, and iv) a detailed evaluation of the reduction of the modeling effort enabled by the transformation in the context of a real-world case study.},

This chapter presents a novel methodology for modeling and performance analysis of distributed systems.

We study a real-world application, and demonstrate the benefits, in terms of modelling power and expressiveness, that QPN models provide over conventional modelling paradigms such as Queuing Networks and Petri Nets. As shown, QPNs facilitate the integration of both hardware and software aspects of system behavior in the same model. In addition to hardware contention and scheduling strategies, using QPNs one can easily model simultaneous resource possession, synchronization, blocking and contention for software resources. By validating the models presented through measurements, we show that they are not just powerful as a specification mechanism, but are also very powerful as a performance analysis and prediction tool. However, currently available tools and techniques for QPN analysis are limited. Improved solution methods, which enable larger models to be analyzed, need to be developed. By demonstrating the power of QPNs as a modelling paradigm in realistic scenarios, we hope to motivate further research in this area.},

We study a real-world application, and demonstrate the benefits, in terms of modelling power and expressiveness, that QPN models provide over conventional modelling paradigms such as Queuing Networks and Petri Nets. As shown, QPNs facilitate the integration of both hardware and software aspects of system behavior in the same model. In addition to hardware contention and scheduling strategies, using QPNs one can easily model simultaneous resource possession, synchronization, blocking and contention for software resources. By validating the models presented through measurements, we show that they are not just powerful as a specification mechanism, but are also very powerful as a performance analysis and prediction tool. However, currently available tools and techniques for QPN analysis are limited. Improved solution methods, which enable larger models to be analyzed, need to be developed. By demonstrating the power of QPNs as a modelling paradigm in realistic scenarios, we hope to motivate further research in this area.},

This raises the challenge of guaranteeing system performance and scalability while at the same time ensuring efficient resource usage. In this paper, we present a historical perspective on the evolution of model-based performance engineering techniques for business information systems focusing on the major developments over the past several decades that have shaped the field. We survey the state-of-the-art on performance modeling and management approaches discussing the ongoing efforts in the community to increasingly bridge the gap between high-level business services and low level performance models. Finally, we wrap up with an outlook on the emergence of self-aware systems engineering as a new research area at the intersection of several computer science disciplines.}},

  abstract = {Event-based communication is used in different domains including telecommunications, transportation, and business information systems to build scalable distributed systems. Such systems typically have stringent requirements for performance and scalability as they provide business and mission critical services. While the use of event-based communication enables loosely-coupled interactions between components and leads to improved system scalability, it makes it much harder for developers to estimate the system's behavior and performance under load due to the decoupling of components and control flow. We present an overview on our approach enabling the modeling and performance prediction of event-based system at the architecture level. Applying a model-to-model transformation, our approach integrates platform-specific performance influences of the underlying middleware while enabling the use of different existing analytical and simulation-based prediction techniques. The results of two real world case studies demonstrate the effectiveness, practicability and accuracy of the proposed modeling and prediction approach.},

Even though there usually is a rough idea on bounds for quality of service, the exact required values may be unclear and subject to trade-offs. Designing architectures that exhibit such good trade-off between multiple quality attributes is hard. Even with a given functional design, many degrees of freedom in the software architecture (e.g. component deployment or server configuration) span a large design space. Automated approaches search the design space with multi-objective metaheuristics such as evolutionary algorithms. However, as quality prediction for a single architecture is computationally expensive, these approaches are time consuming. In this work, we enhance an automated improvement approach to take into account bounds for quality of service in order to focus the search on interesting regions of the objective space, while still allowing trade-offs after the search. We compare two different constraint handling techniques to consider the bounds. To validate our approach, we applied both techniques to an architecture model of a component-based business information system. We compared both techniques to an unbounded search in 4 scenarios. Every scenario was examined with 10 optimization runs, each investigating around 1600 architectural candidates. The results indicate that the integration of quality of service bounds during the optimization process can improve the quality of the solutions found, however, the effect depends on the scenario, i.e. the problem and the quality requirements. The best results were achieved for costs requirements: The approach was able to decrease the time needed to find good solutions in the interesting regions of the objective space by 25\% on average.},

<div id="abstract-of-KuHeKiRe2011-ResourceElasticity" class="inline-bib" style="display:none;"><blockquote>{Elasticity is the ability of a software system to dynamically scale the amount of the resources it provides to clients as their workloads increase or decrease. Elasticity is praised as a key advantage of cloud computing, where computing resources are dynamically added and released. However, there exists no concise or formal definition of elasticity, and thus no approaches to quantify it have been developed so far. Existing work on cloud computing is limited to the technical view of implementing elastic systems, and definitions or scalability have not been extended to cover elasticity. In this report, we present a detailed discussion of elasticity, propose techniques for quantifying and measuring it, and outline next steps to be taken for enabling comparisons between cloud computing offerings on the basis of elasticity. We also present preliminary work on measuring elasticity of resource pools provided by the Java Virtual Machine.}</blockquote></div>

In contrast to previous approaches, which have attempted mainly to formalize the common service delivery models (i.e., Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, and Software-as-a-Service), in this work, we propose a formalism for describing common cloud usage scenarios referred to as cloud usage patterns.

We propose a simple yet expressive textual and visual language for our formalism, and we show how it can be used in practice for describing a variety of real-world cloud usage scenarios.

Given this scenario, we first show how to instrument WSC in order to allow a controlling of the service level through switching the employed service variant. Second, we show how the desired self-manageability can be designed and implemented by means of a WSC manageability infrastructure. The presented approach is based on widely accepted methodologies and standards from the area of application and web service management, in particular the WBEM standards.

<div id="abstract-of-NoKoJuTo2008-JSS-GridAutoQoS" class="inline-bib" style="display:none;"><blockquote>As Grid Computing increasingly enters the commercial domain, performance and Quality of Service (QoS) issues are becoming a major concern. The inherent complexity, heterogeneity and dynamics of Grid computing environments pose some challenges in managing their capacity to ensure that QoS requirements are continuously met. In this paper, a comprehensive framework for autonomic QoS control in enterprise Grid environments using online simulation is proposed. The paper presents a novel methodology for designing autonomic QoS-aware resource managers that have the capability to predict the performance of the Grid components they manage and allocate resources in such a way that service level agreements are honored. Support for advanced features such as autonomic workload characterization on-the-fly, dynamic deployment of Grid servers on demand, as well as dynamic system reconfiguration after a server failure is provided. The goal is to make the Grid middleware self-configurable and adaptable to changes in the system environment and workload. The approach is subjected to an extensive experimental evaluation in the context of a real-world Grid environment and its effectiveness, practicality and performance are demonstrated.</blockquote></div>

  abstract = {Today, the architectures of software systems are not stable for their whole lifetime but often adapted driven by business needs. Preserving their quality characteristics beyond each of these changes requires deep knowledge of the requirements and the systems themselves. Proper documentation reduces the risk that knowledge is lost and hence is a base for the system's maintenance in the long-run. However, the influence of architectural documentation on the maintainability of software systems is neglected in current quality assessment methods. They are limited to documentation for anticipated change scenarios and do not provide a general assessment approach. In this paper, we propose a maturity model for architecture documentation. It is shaped relative to growing quality preservation maturity and independent of specific technologies or products. It supports the weighting of necessary effort against reducing long-term risks in the maintenance phase.

This scenario is used as a basis in SPEC?s new SPECjms benchmark which will be the world?s first industry-standard benchmark for MOM.</blockquote></div>

<div id="abstract-of-SaKoBaBu2007-EPEW-WorkloadChar_SPECjms2007" class="inline-bib" style="display:none;"><blockquote>Message-oriented middleware (MOM) is at the core of a vast number of financial services and telco applications, and is gaining increasing traction in other industries, such as manufacturing, transportation, health-care and supply chain management. There is a strong interest in the end user and analyst communities for a standardized benchmark suite for evaluating the performance and scalability of MOM. In this paper, we present a workload characterization of the SPECjms2007 benchmark which is the world's first industry-standard benchmark specialized for MOM. In addition to providing standard workload and metrics for MOM performance, the benchmark provides a flexible performance analysis framework that allows users to customize the workload according to their requirements. The workload characterization presented in this paper serves two purposes i) to help users understand the internal components of the SPECjms2007 workload and the way they are scaled, ii) to show how the workload can be customized to exercise and evaluate selected aspects of MOM performance.We discuss how the various features supported by the benchmark can be exploited for in-depth performance analysis of MOM infrastructures.</blockquote></div>

There is a strong interest in the commercial and research domains for a standardized benchmark suite for evaluating the performance and scalability of MOM. With all major vendors adopting JMS (Java Message Service) as a standard interface to MOM servers, there is at last a means for creating a standardized workload for evaluating products in this space. This paper describes a novel application in the supply chain management domain that has been specifically designed as a representative workload scenario for evaluating the performance and scalability of MOM products. This scenario is used as a basis in SPEC's new SPECjms benchmark which will be the world's first industry-standard benchmark for MOM.},

Building performance models involves the estimation of resource demands, i.e., estimating the time a unit of work spends obtaining service from a resource. A number of approaches to estimating the resource demands of a system already exist, e.g., based on regression analysis or stochastic filtering. These approaches differ in their accuracy, their robustness and their applicability. For instance, there are notable differences in the amount and type of measurement data that is required as input. However, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of these approaches in a representative context does not exist. In this thesis, we give an overview of the state-of-the-art in resource demand estimation and develop a classification scheme for approaches to resource demand estimation. We implement a sub-set of these estimation approaches and evaluate them in a representative environment. We analyze the influence of various factors of the environment on the estimation accuracy, considering the impact of current technologies, such as multi-core processors and virtualization. Our work improves the comparability of existing estimation approaches and facilitates the selection of an approach in a given application scenario. Additionally, it shows possible directions for future research in the field of resource demand estimation.},

The considered complex service composition process consists of three stages: complex service structure, scenario and plan composition. Complex service structure contains a set of required functionalities and precedence relations between them, and is derived directly from a service level agreement. Service scenario is derived from service structure by choosing the optimal (in the sense of certain quality criterion) order of execution of required functionalities. Finally, a service plan emerges from a scenario by choosing the best versions of atomic services for the delivery of required functionalities. For such distinguished composition process methods for complex service scenario and execution plan optimization are proposed. Optimization of a complex service scenario is based on the analysis of possible parallel executions of required functionalities. In order to deliver required level of the quality of service, well known QoS assurance models (i.e.: best effort, integrated services and differentiated services) are applied in the process of complex service execution plan optimization.},

  year = {2010},
  abstract = {In this work, a method for the QoS-aware complex service composition in SOA-based systems is presented. The considered complex service composition process consists of three stages: complex service structure, scenario and plan composition. Complex service structure contains a set of required functionalities and precedence relations between them, and is derived directly from a service level agreement. Service scenario is derived from service structure by choosing the optimal (in the sense of certain quality criterion) order of execution of required functionalities. Finally, a service plan emerges from a scenario by choosing the best versions of atomic services for the delivery of required functionalities. For such distinguished composition process methods for complex service scenario and execution plan optimization are proposed. Optimization of a complex service scenario is based on the analysis of possible parallel executions of required functionalities. In order to deliver required level of the quality of service, well known QoS assurance models (i.e.: best effort, integrated services and differentiated services) are applied in the process of complex service execution plan optimization.},

  abstract = {The paper is devoted to the problem of mobility and resources management in heterogeneous wireless networks. It is assumed that in certain area covered by multiple overlapping wireless networks there is certain number of mobile client which consume networks resources by use of available communication services (e.g., voice or data transmission) delivered by network providers. Moreover it is assumed, that communication services continuity may be assured with use of common handover techniques supporting clients mobility (e.g: MIPv6, IEEE 802.21, etc.). The task of mobility and resources management consists of making decisions concerning the moment and the network to which particular clients should be handed over in order to optimize certain quality criterion (e.g. utilization of network resources). In this paper we show that gathering knowledge about clients movement and prediction of their future position may significantly improve the overall quality of delivered services and network resources utilization.},

Novelty of the formulated task consists of assumption that the applications assigned with resources of one machine can be migrated to another machine during system lifetime. The formulated task has been solved using proposed heuristic optimization method. Due to non-convex set of valid solutions the optimization procedure has been decomposed into two stages and forms approach similar to the relax-and-round approach. Proposed decomposition approach facilitates fast algorithm convergence and guaranties that achieved solution satisfies assumed constraints},

The process of delivering e-health services to users consists of two major tasks: service personalization and resources allocation. In this paper we introduce a use-cases of e-health system and distinguish services that can be offered. In order to satisfy user requirements one have to manage resources properly especially when communication conditions change (e.g. in an ambulance).

It is assumed that in certain areas covered by multiple overlapping wireless networks there are a certain number of mobile clients that consume networks resources by use of the available communication services (e.g., voice or data transmission) delivered by network providers. Moreover, it is assumed that the continuity of communication services may be assured by the use of common handover techniques supporting client mobility (e.g., Mobile IPv6, IEEE 802.21, etc.). The task of mobility and resource management consists of making decisions concerning the moment and the network to which particular clients should be handed over in order to optimize certain quality criterion (e.g., utilization of network resources).

  abstract = {For years the CPU clock frequency was the key to improve processor performance. Nowadays, modern processors enable performance improvements by increasing the number of cores. However, existing software needs to be adapted to be able to utilize multiple cores. Such an adaptation poses many challenges in the field of discrete-event software simulation. Decades of intensive research have been spent to find a general solution for parallel discrete event simulation. In this context, QNs and PNs have been extensively studied. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is only one previous work that considers the concurrent simulation of QPN [Juergens1997]. This work focuses on comparing different synchronization algorithms and excludes a majority of lookahead calculation and net decomposition. In this thesis, we build upon and extend this work. For this purpose, we adapted and extended findings from QNs, PNs and parallel simulation in general. We apply our findings to SimQPN, which is a sequential simulation engine for QPN. Among other application areas, SimQPN is currently applied to online performance prediction for which a speedup due to parallelization is desirable. We present a parallel SimQPN implementation that employs application level and event level parallelism. A validation ensures the functional correctness of the new parallel implementations. The parallelization of multiple runs enables almost linear speedup. We parallelized the execution of a single run by the use of a conservative barrier-based synchronization algorithm. The speedup for a single run depends on the capability of the model. Hence, a number of experiments on different net characteristics were conducted showing that for certain models a superlinear speedup is possible.},

Decades of intensive research have been spent to find a general solution for parallel discrete event simulation. In this context, QNs and PNs have been extensively studied. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is only one previous work that considers the concurrent simulation of QPN [Juergens1997]. This work focuses on comparing different synchronization algorithms and excludes a majority of lookahead calculation and net decomposition. In this thesis, we build upon and extend this work. For this purpose, we adapted and extended findings from QNs, PNs and parallel simulation in general. We apply our findings to SimQPN, which is a sequential simulation engine for QPN. Among other application areas, SimQPN is currently applied to online performance prediction for which a speedup due to parallelization is desirable. We present a parallel SimQPN implementation that employs application level and event level parallelism. A validation ensures the functional correctness of the new parallel implementations. The parallelization of multiple runs enables almost linear speedup. We parallelized the execution of a single run by the use of a conservative barrier-based synchronization algorithm. The speedup for a single run depends on the capability of the model. Hence, a number of experiments on different net characteristics were conducted showing that for certain models a superlinear speedup is possible.

This approach is commonly used by SaaS providers to reduce the costs for service provisioning. Tenants also expect to be isolated in terms of the performance they observe and the providers inability to offer performance guarantees is a major obstacle for potential cloud customers. To guarantee an isolated performance it is essential to control the resources used by a tenant. This is a challenge, because the layers of the execution environment, responsible for controlling resource usage (e.g., operating system), normally do not have knowledge about entities defined at the application level and thus they cannot distinguish between different tenants. Furthermore, it is hard to predict how tenant requests propagate through the multiple layers of the execution environment down to the physical resource layer. The intended abstraction of the application from the resource controlling layers does not allow to solely solving this problem in the application. In this paper, we propose an approach which applies resource demand estimation techniques in combination with a request based admission control. The resource demand estimation is used to determine resource consumption information for individual requests. The admission control mechanism uses this knowledge to delay requests originating from tenants that exceed their allocated resource share. The proposed method is validated by a widely accepted benchmark showing its applicability in a setup motivated by today's platform environments.}},

Multi-tenancy is an approach to share one application instance among multiple customers by providing each of them a dedicated view. This approach is commonly used by SaaS providers to reduce the costs for service provisioning. Tenants also expect to be isolated in terms of the performance they observe and the providers inability to offer performance guarantees is a major obstacle for potential cloud customers. To guarantee an isolated performance it is essential to control the resources used by a tenant. This is a challenge, because the layers of the execution environment, responsible for controlling resource usage (e.g., operating system), normally do not have knowledge about entities defined at the application level and thus they cannot distinguish between different tenants. Furthermore, it is hard to predict how tenant requests propagate through the multiple layers of the execution environment down to the physical resource layer. The intended abstraction of the application from the resource controlling layers does not allow to solely solving this problem in the application. In this paper, we propose an approach which applies resource demand estimation techniques in combination with a request based admission control.

An exact dot product is one of the features of the upcoming interval standard (IEEE Interval Standard Working Group, P1788. http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/1788/). Usually an accumulator is realized as a memory block with operations to add floating point numbers and products. Several variants have been proposed to avoid carry rippling: use separate accumulators for positive and negative numbers, initialize the accu with a pattern not equal to zero, or perform a kind of carry look-ahead-technique. All these approaches are described in detail in Kulisch (Computer arithmetic and validityÂ—theory, implementation, and applications.

In this paper we propose a long accumulator similar to a carry-save adder. The main idea is to augment the long accumulator with cache information. The cache is used to store the carries or borrows, instead of propagating them through the whole accumulator every time. Due to the cache, operations are kept local in our approach. The full information of the exact result is represented by the accu and the cache. When we want to deliver the result we have to add the contents of the cache into the accumulator. In this paper we present an implementation in software and compare it with other approaches. Furthermore we discuss the advantages of this algorithm for a hardware implementation.},

Our first result is a saving of rounding mode switches which considerably increases the performance. Our second result deals with handling the discontinuity flag that will probably be decided to be raised whenever a function is called outside its domain (loose evaluation). We discuss several alternatives and propose an expression related flag that can be used in a thread safe manner. Both results are reviewed with respect to the coming IEEE standard for interval arithmetic.},

  abstract = {{Today's software systems are expected to deliver reliable performance under highly variable load intensities while at the same time making efficient use of dynamically allocated resources. Conventional benchmarking frameworks provide limited support for emulating such highly variable and dynamic load profiles and workload scenarios. Industrial benchmarks typically use workloads with constant or stepwise increasing load intensity, or they simply replay recorded workload traces. Based on this observation, I identify the need for means allowing flexible definition of load profiles and address this by introducing two meta-models at different abstraction levels. At the lower abstraction level, the Descartes Load Intensity Meta-Model (DLIM) offers a structured and accessible way of describing the load intensity over time by editing and combining mathematical functions. The high-level Descartes Load Intensity Meta-Model (hl-DLIM) allows the description of load variations using few defined parameters that characterize the seasonal patterns, trends, bursts, and noise parts. Using these parameters, hl-DLIM is capable of describing a subset of most common load intensity variations. During the work on this thesis I developed LIMBO - an Eclipse-based tool for modeling variable load intensity profiles based on DLIM and hl-DLIM as underlying modeling formalisms. LIMBO provides visualization for DLIM instances and a model creation wizard based on hl-DLIM parameters. It also offers three automated model extraction processes with which to extract DLIM and hl-DLIM instances from existing arrival rate traces. It also offers a model-to-model transformation from hl-DLIM to DLIM. I demonstrate that both meta-models are capable of capturing real-world load profiles with acceptable accuracy, having an average median deviation of 19.9\% from the original trace. This is done by comparing nine different real life traces, which were measured over duration of two weeks to seven months, to their respective model instances as extracted by the automated model extraction processes. I also evaluate the usability and accessibility of LIMBO based on a questionnaire which was answered by eight computer scientists from five different organizations within the performance engineering community.}},

  abstract = {The computation of the first or higher derivatives of a function is a common problem in scientific computing. The most obvious approach to compute the derivative values is the symbolic differentiation which applies the well known rules of differentiation onto the expression to compute a formal expression of the derivative function. Another method called numerical differentiation is the approximation of the derivative with difference quotients. Superior to these approaches is the automatic differentiation which is a technique to compute a value of the expression and the derivative together by applying the well known rules of differentiation. The difference to symbolic differentiation is that it propagates numerical values instead of formal expressions. Commonly used implementations of automatic differentiation may be divided into two categories, the implementations using operator overloading to compute the values of the function and the derivative together in contrast to special tools applying the technique of source transformation to mix in the expressions to compute the derivatives. Both of these techniques are somehow inflexible in the manner that the operators are not overloaded for high order differentiation or additional tools are required for the source transformation. In this paper we use expression templates and template meta programming to mix in the code for the partial differentiation. The main concept is to apply the symbolic differentiation at compile time only onto the single operations of the expression tree to create the run time code for the automatic differentiation. This has two advantages, we can, in theory, compute derivatives of any order and secondly the differentiation of the operations is done with types. This means that the symbolic differentiation of an operation with a specified order is performed only once by the compiler. Our generic approach provides a domain specific language for partial automatic differentiation of an arbitrary order which is easily extendable by new types. Several C++ and especially C++0x template programming concepts and techniques like variadic templates, type lists or variadic tuples are used to realize the specification of the automatic differentiation at compile time.

  abstract = {{Auto-scaling features offered by today's cloud infrastructures provide increased flexibility, especially for customers that experience high variations in the load intensity over time. However, auto-scaling features introduce new system quality attributes when considering their accuracy and timing. Therefore, distinguishing between different offerings has become a complex task, as it is not yet supported by reliable metrics and measurement approaches. This thesis discusses the shortcomings of existing approaches for measuring and evaluating elastic behavior and proposes a novel benchmark methodology specifically designed for evaluating the elasticity aspects of modern cloud platforms. The benchmarking concept uses open workloads with realistic load intensity profiles in order to induce resource demand variations on the benchmarked system and compares them with the actual variation of the allocated resources. To ensure a fair elasticity comparison between systems with di erent underlying hardware performance, the load intensity profiles are adjusted to induce identical resource demand variations on all compared platforms. Furthermore, this thesis proposes new metrics that capture the accuracy of resource allocations and deallocations, as well as the timing aspects of an auto-scaling mechanism, explicitly. The benchmark concept comprises four activities: The System Analysis evaluates the load processing capabilities of the benchmarked platform for different scaling stages. The Benchmark Calibration then uses the analysis results and adjusts a given load intensity profile in a system specific manner. Within the Measurement activity, the evaluated platformis exposed to a load varying ccording to the adjusted intensity profile. The final Elasticity Evaluation measures the quality of the observed elastic behavior using the proposed elasticity metrics. A java based framework for benchmarking the elasticity of IaaS cloud platforms called BUNGEE implements this concept and automates benchmarking activities. At the moment, BUNGEE allows to analyze the elasticity of CloudStack and Amazon Web Service (AWS) based clouds that scale CPU-bound virtual machines horizontally. Within an extensive evaluation, this thesis demonstrates the ability of the proposed elasticity metrics to consistently rank elastic systems on an ordinal scale. A case study that uses a realistic load profile, consisting of several millions of request submissions, exhibits the applicability of the benchmarking methodology for realistic scenarios. The case study is conducted on a private as well as on a public cloud and uses eleven different elasticity rule configurations and four instance types assigned to resources with different levels of effciency.}},

This thesis discusses the shortcomings of existing approaches for measuring and evaluating elastic behavior and proposes a novel benchmark methodology specifically designed for evaluating the elasticity aspects of modern cloud platforms. The benchmarking concept uses open workloads with realistic load intensity profiles in order to induce resource demand variations on the benchmarked system and compares them with the actual variation of the allocated resources. To ensure a fair elasticity comparison between systems with di erent underlying hardware performance, the load intensity profiles are adjusted to induce identical resource demand variations on all compared platforms. Furthermore, this thesis proposes new metrics that capture the accuracy of resource allocations and deallocations, as well as the timing aspects of an auto-scaling mechanism, explicitly. The benchmark concept comprises four activities: The System Analysis evaluates the load processing capabilities of the benchmarked platform for different scaling stages. The Benchmark Calibration then uses the analysis results and adjusts a given load intensity profile in a system specific manner. Within the Measurement activity, the evaluated platformis exposed to a load varying ccording to the adjusted intensity profile. The final Elasticity Evaluation measures the quality of the observed elastic behavior using the proposed elasticity metrics. A java based framework for benchmarking the elasticity of IaaS cloud platforms called BUNGEE implements this concept and automates benchmarking activities. At the moment, BUNGEE allows to analyze the elasticity of CloudStack and Amazon Web Service (AWS) based clouds that scale CPU-bound virtual machines horizontally. Within an extensive evaluation, this thesis demonstrates the ability of the proposed elasticity metrics to consistently rank elastic systems on an ordinal scale. A case study that uses a realistic load profile, consisting of several millions of request submissions, exhibits the applicability of the benchmarking methodology for realistic scenarios. The case study is conducted on a private as well as on a public cloud and uses eleven different elasticity rule configurations and four instance types assigned to resources with different levels of effciency.

  abstract = {{ Energy efficiency of servers has become a significant research topic over the last years, as server energy consumption varies depending on multiple factors, such as server utilization and workload type. Server energy analysis and estimation must take all relevant factors into account to ensure reliable estimates and conclusions. Thorough system analysis requires benchmarks capable of testing different system resources at different load levels using multiple workload types. Server energy estimation approaches, on the other hand, require knowledge about the interactions of these factors for the creation of accurate power models. Common approaches to energy-aware workload classification classify workloads depending on the resource types used by the different workloads. However, they rarely take into account differences in workloads targeting the same resources. Industrial energy-efficiency benchmarks typically do not evaluate the system's energy consumption at different resource load levels, and they only provide data for system analysis at maximum system load. In this paper, we benchmark multiple server configurations using the CPU worklets included in SPEC's Server Efficiency Rating Tool (SERT). We evaluate the impact of load levels and different CPU workloads on power consumption and energy efficiency. We analyze how functions approximating the measured power consumption differ over multiple server configurations and architectures. We show that workloads targeting the same resource can differ significantly in their power draw and energy efficiency. The power consumption of a given workload type varies depending on utilization, hardware and software configuration. The power consumption of CPU-intensive workloads does not scale uniformly with increased load, nor do hardware or software configuration changes affect it in a uniform manner.}},

Benchmarking of systems under these constraints is difficult, as state-of-the-art benchmarking frameworks provide only limited support for emulating such dynamic and highly variable load profiles for the creation of realistic workload scenarios. Industrial benchmarks typically confine themselves to workloads with constant or stepwise increasing loads. Alternatively, they support replaying of recorded load traces. Statistical load intensity descriptions also do not sufficiently capture concrete pattern load profile variations over time. To address these issues, we present the Descartes Load Intensity Model (DLIM). DLIM provides a modeling formalism for describing load intensity variations over time. A DLIM instance can be used as a compact representation of a recorded load intensity trace, providing a powerful tool for benchmarking and performance analysis. As manually obtaining DLIM instances can be time consuming, we present three different automated extraction methods, which also help to enable autonomous system analysis for self-adaptive systems. Model expressiveness is validated using the presented extraction methods. Extracted DLIM instances exhibit a median modeling error of 12.4% on average over nine different real-world traces covering between two weeks and seven months. Additionally, extraction methods perform orders of magnitude faster than existing time series decomposition approaches.},

Today's system developers and operators face the challenge of creating software systems that make efficient use of dynamically allocated resources under highly variable and dynamic load profiles, while at the same time delivering reliable performance. Benchmarking of systems under these constraints is difficult, as state-of-the-art benchmarking frameworks provide only limited support for emulating such dynamic and highly variable load profiles for the creation of realistic workload scenarios. Industrial benchmarks typically confine themselves to workloads with constant or stepwise increasing loads. Alternatively, they support replaying of recorded load traces. Statistical load intensity descriptions also do not sufficiently capture concrete pattern load profile variations over time. To address these issues, we present the Descartes Load Intensity Model (DLIM). DLIM provides a modeling formalism for describing load intensity variations over time. A DLIM instance can be used as a compact representation of a recorded load intensity trace, providing a powerful tool for benchmarking and performance analysis. As manually obtaining DLIM instances can be time consuming, we present three different automated extraction methods, which also help to enable autonomous system analysis for self-adaptive systems. Model expressiveness is validated using the presented extraction methods. Extracted DLIM instances exhibit a median modeling error of 12.4% on average over nine different real-world traces covering between two weeks and seven months. Additionally, extraction methods perform orders of magnitude faster than existing time series decomposition approaches.

In order to ensure quality of service for such applications while avoiding over-provisioning, resources need to be dynamically adapted to accommodate the current workload demands. Many memory-intensive applications are not suitable for the traditional horizontal scaling approach often used for runtime performance management, as it relies on complex and expensive state replication.

To this end, we propose an extended forecasting technique that leverages meta-knowledge, such as calendar information, to improve the forecast accuracy. In addition, we develop an application controller to adjust settings associated with application memory management during memory reconfiguration. Our evaluation using real-world traces shows that the forecast accuracy quantified with the MASE error metric can be improved by 11-59%.

In addition to time-independent constraints regarding aspects like scalability, resilience, and control plane communication delays, dynamically changing network conditions like traffic patterns or bandwidth demands need to be considered as well. Consequently, such dynamic environments call for a regular and fast recalculation of placements in order to adapt to the current situation in a timely manner. While an exhaustive evaluation of all possible solutions can be performed within a practically feasible time frame for small and medium-sized networks, such an approach is out of scope for large problem instances which have significantly higher time and memory requirements. Therefore, this work investigates a specialized heuristic, which takes into account a particular set of optimization objectives and returns solutions representing the possible trade-offs between them. Due to its low computation time and acceptable margin of error, this heuristic can be employed by automatic decision systems operating in dynamic environments.

  abstract = {{Energy efficiency of servers has become a significant issue over the last years. Load distribution plays a crucial role in the improvement of energy efficiency as (un-)balancing strategies can be leveraged to distribute load over one or multiple systems in a way in which resources are utilized at high performance, yet low overall power consumption. This can be achieved on multiple levels, from load distribution on single CPU cores to machine level load balancing on distributed systems. With modern day server architectures providing load balancing opportunities at several layers, answering the question of optimal load distribution has become non-trivial. Work has to be distributed hierarchically in a fashion that enables maximum energy efficiency at each level. Current approaches balance load based on generalized assumptions about the energy efficiency of servers. These assumptions are based either on very machine-specific or highly generalized observations that may or may not hold true over a variety of systems and configurations. In this paper, we use a modified version of the SPEC SERT suite to measure the energy efficiency of a variety of hierarchical load distribution strategies on single and multi-node systems. We introduce a new strategy and evaluate energy efficiency for homogeneous and heterogeneous workloads over different hardware configurations. Our results show that the selection of a load distribution strategy depends heavily on workload, system utilization, as well as hardware. Used in conjunction with existing strategies, our new load distribution strategy can reduce a single system's power consumption by up to 10.7%.}},

Energy efficiency of servers has become a significant issue over the last years. Load distribution plays a crucial role in the improvement of energy efficiency as (un-)balancing strategies can be leveraged to distribute load over one or multiple systems in a way in which resources are utilized at high performance, yet low overall power consumption. This can be achieved on multiple levels, from load distribution on single CPU cores to machine level load balancing on distributed systems. With modern day server architectures providing load balancing opportunities at several layers, answering the question of optimal load distribution has become non-trivial. Work has to be distributed hierarchically in a fashion that enables maximum energy efficiency at each level. Current approaches balance load based on generalized assumptions about the energy efficiency of servers. These assumptions are based either on very machine-specific or highly generalized observations that may or may not hold true over a variety of systems and configurations. In this paper, we use a modified version of the SPEC SERT suite to measure the energy efficiency of a variety of hierarchical load distribution strategies on single and multi-node systems. We introduce a new strategy and evaluate energy efficiency for homogeneous and heterogeneous workloads over different hardware configurations. Our results show that the selection of a load distribution strategy depends heavily on workload, system utilization, as well as hardware. Used in conjunction with existing strategies, our new load distribution strategy can reduce a single system's power consumption by up to 10.7%.

  abstract = {DevOps is a trend towards a tighter integration between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams. The need for such an integration is driven by the requirement to continuously adapt enterprise applications (EAs) to changes in the business environment. As of today, DevOps concepts have been primarily introduced to ensure a constant flow of features and bug fixes into new releases from a functional perspective. In order to integrate a non-functional perspective into these DevOps concepts this report focuses on tools, activities, and processes to ensure one of the most important quality attributes of a software system, namely performance. Performance describes system properties concerning its timeliness and use of resources. Common metrics are response time, throughput, and resource utilization. Performance goals for EAs are typically defined by setting upper and/or lower bounds for these metrics and specific business transactions. In order to ensure that such performance goals can be met, several activities are required during development and operation of these systems as well as during the transition from Dev to Ops. Activities during development are typically summarized by the term Software Performance Engineering (SPE), whereas activities during operations are called Application Performance Management (APM). SPE and APM were historically tackled independently from each other, but the newly emerging DevOps concepts require and enable a tighter integration between both activity streams. This report presents existing solutions to support this integration as well as open research challenges in this area. The report starts by defining EAs and summarizes their characteristics that make performance evaluations for these systems particularly challenging. It continues by describing our understanding of DevOps and explaining the roots of this trend to set the context for the remaining parts of the report. Afterwards, performance management activities that are common in both life cycle phases are explained, until the particularities of SPE and APM are discussed in separate sections. Finally, the report concludes by outlining activities and challenges to support the rapid iteration between Dev and Ops.},

abstract = {DevOps is a trend towards a tighter integration between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams. The need for such an integration is driven by the requirement to continuously adapt enterprise applications (EAs) to changes in the business environment. As of today, DevOps concepts have been primarily introduced to ensure a constant flow of features and bug fixes into new releases from a functional perspective. In order to integrate a non-functional perspective into these DevOps concepts this report focuses on tools, activities, and processes to ensure one of the most important quality attributes of a software system, namely performance. Performance describes system properties concerning its timeliness and use of resources. Common metrics are response time, throughput, and resource utilization. Performance goals for EAs are typically defined by setting upper and/or lower bounds for these metrics and specific business transactions. In order to ensure that such performance goals can be met, several activities are required during development and operation of these systems as well as during the transition from Dev to Ops. Activities during development are typically summarized by the term Software Performance Engineering (SPE), whereas activities during operations are called Application Performance Management (APM). SPE and APM were historically tackled independently from each other, but the newly emerging DevOps concepts require and enable a tighter integration between both activity streams. This report presents existing solutions to support this integration as well as open research challenges in this area. The report starts by defining EAs and summarizes their characteristics that make performance evaluations for these systems particularly challenging. It continues by describing our understanding of DevOps and explaining the roots of this trend to set the context for the remaining parts of the report. Afterwards, performance management activities that are common in both life cycle phases are explained, until the particularities of SPE and APM are discussed in separate sections. Finally, the report concludes by outlining activities and challenges to support the rapid iteration between Dev and Ops.},

As with all measurements, repeatability and reproducibility of power measurements is a major challenge. Nominally identical systems can have different power consumption running the same workload under otherwise identical conditions. This behavior can also be observed for individual system components. Specifically, CPU power consumption can vary amongst different samples of nominally identical CPUs. This in turn has a significant impact on the overall system power, considering that a system's processor is the largest and most dynamic power consumer of the overall system. The concrete impact of CPU sample power variations is unknown, as comprehensive studies about differences in power consumption for nominally identical systems are currently missing. We address this lack of studies by conducting measurements on four different processor types from two different architectures. For each of these types, we compare up to 30 physical processor samples with a total sum of 90 samples over all processor types. We analyze the variations in power consumption for the different samples using six different workloads over five load levels. Additionally, we analyze how these variations change for different processor core counts and architectures. The results of this paper show that selection of a processor sample can have a statistically significant impact on power consumption. With no correlation to performance, power consumption for nominally identical processors can differ as much as 29.6\% in idle and 19.5\% at full load. We also show that these variations change over different architectures and processor types.}},
